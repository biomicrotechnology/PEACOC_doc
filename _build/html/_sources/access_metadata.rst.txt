******************************************
Accessing metadata and diagnostics metrics
******************************************

You can render metadata and diagnostics metrics automatically in human readable form using odML or yaml. A single metadata
and/or diagnostics file is created for a specific recording.

**Metadata** includes the parameters used for analyses and details about who analyzed the data when and the paths to the
figures created during the different analysis steps. Therefore metadata is sub-section into the fields:

- `EdDetection`, for spectral and amplitude based spike detection

- `SpikeSorting`, for sorting of spikes to remove false positives

- `BurstClassification`, for burst detection and classification

**Diagnostics metrics** include metrics we commonly use to address the severity of epilepsy. These include:

- `rate(spikes)`, the rate of spikes detected during the recording (/s)

- `rate(high-load)`, the rate of high-load bursts (/min)

- `tfrac(high-load)`, the fraction of time spent in high-load bursts

- `tfrac(bursts)`, the fraction of time spent in bursts of any kind

- `tfrac(free)`, the fraction of time spent outside of bursts

- `burstiness`, (std(ISI)-mean(ISI))/(std(ISI)+mean(ISI)); ISI being interspike interval, see Goh and Barab√°si (2008)


General
=======

Before you start, make sure that you are in the virtual environment for PEACOC if you have :ref:`set up one <virtual_env>`::

    > workon peacoc

... and make sure you are in the folder of PEACOC. My command-line would look like this::

    (peacoc) weltgeischt@heulsuse:~/PEACOC_tutorial/PEACOC


The general **command structure** for rendering metadata and diagnostics in both formats looks like this::

    > python runthrough/metadata_diagnostics.py --format=<format> -<options> <path/to/paramfile.yml>

`<format>` can be either `yaml` or `odml`, depending on your taste of filetype

`<options>` can be:

- `d` for rendering diagnostic metrics

- `m` for rendering metadata metrics

- `md` for rendering metadata and disagnostic metrics in a single file


.. _metaOdml:

odML
====

If you want to know more about odML, have a look at `this <https://github.com/G-Node/python-odml/blob/master/doc/tutorial.rst>`_.
To be able to render something in odML format, you need to have odml installed. You can do so using pip::

    > pip3 install odml


.. _example1_meta:

Example 1
---------

Now, lets render **diagnostic metrics** of our example recording in **odML format**::

    > python runthrough/metadata_diagnostics.py --format=odml -d /home/weltgeischt/PEACOC_tutorial/run_params/my_recording_params.yml

This generates a file *my_recording__diagnostics.xml*  at :ref:`the folder we had assigned to store the data <replacement_params>`,
in my case */home/weltgeischt/PEACOC_tutorial/my_results/data/my_recording*:

.. image:: _static/screenshots/md_diagnostics_odml_folder.png
    :width: 300
    :align: center

Open the file in your browser (e.g. right click on the file and select `Open With > Firefox`). It should look like this:

.. image:: _static/screenshots/md_diagnostics_odml1.png
    :width: 500
    :align: center

If you now click at the blue `Diagnostics` tab, it will bring you to all the beautiful diagnostic metrics:

    :width: 500
    :align: center


.. _example2_meta:

Example 2
---------

Now let's render **metadata** in **odML format**. You type the same as in :ref:`the previous example<example1_meta>`,
only that you now use option `-m` instead of `-d`::

    > python runthrough/metadata_diagnostics.py --format=odml -m /home/weltgeischt/PEACOC_tutorial/run_params/my_recording_params.yml

This generates a file *my_recording__metadata.xml* in the results folder. Open it in your browser. As you see it displays a
section for each analysis step, with subsection called `..._methods` and `..._info`. In the former you find the parameters
used for running the analyses, in the latter you have links to figures generated and who ran the procedure when. Clicking
on the respective subsection will directly bring you to its content.

Example 3
---------

To produce a single file that contains both **metadata and diagnostic metrics** in **odML format**, use option `-md`::

    > python runthrough/metadata_diagnostics.py  --format=odml -md /home/weltgeischt/PEACOC_tutorial/run_params/my_recording_params.yml

The file generated is called *my_recording__metadata_diagnostics.xml* and also resides in the main results folder.
As you see, now the file incorporates both, the diagnostic metrics from :ref:`example1_meta`, and the metadata from :ref:`example2_meta`:

.. image:: _static/screenshots/md_metadataAndDiagnostics_odml.png
    :width: 500
    :align: center


.. _metaYML:

YAML
====

For the output format **yaml** it works exactly the same as described for odML in the previous section, i.e. you can use
option `-d`, `-m` or `-md`. For example, to get the diagnostic metrics you type::

    > python runthrough/metadata_diagnostics.py --format=yaml -d /home/weltgeischt/PEACOC_tutorial/run_params/my_recording_params.yml

This generates a file *my_recording__diagnostics.yml* in the results folder. Just open this file with some basic text editor (by clicking on it):

.. image:: _static/screenshots/md_diagnostics_yml.png
    :width: 700
    :align: center

If you are not in the mood of :ref:`accessing the results through matlab or python <access_results>`, you can conveniently read some essential diagnostic
metrics from this file.
